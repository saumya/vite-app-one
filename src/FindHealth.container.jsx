                        The service project is now down. 
                        We <mark>do not support</mark> it anymore in terms of <mark>hand holding</mark>.
                        However, the project is always available to anyone who wants to use it.

                            Mostly support. To run it we needed funding and could not run it after sometime.
                            Initially, we thought the project can survive with donations. It did not happen.

                                    No one seems to understand privacy! 
                                    It became too much to push that idea now. Probably, it will happen in future.

                            From the beginning it is our idea to work in open.
                            It stays open.

                    It was a nice run. We made it for the purpose of Health and Privacy. 
                    It is achievable and very much a possibilty. 
                    Currently <i>people are obsessed with medicine than health</i>. 
                    It is about the time, when people will care about their own health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Privacy is another thing to make people understand today. This is sure will comeback soon.
